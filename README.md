# Mice-MUSCULUS
The objective is to identify subsets of proteins that are discriminant between different classes of mice. The dataset includes protein expression levels in the cerebral cortex of both control and Down syndrome mice subjected to context fear conditioning. The aim is to classify the mice into eight distinct classes based on genotype, behaviour, and treatment.
